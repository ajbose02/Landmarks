An iOS app for discovering and sharing places around the world. Follows Apple Developer's SwiftUI tutorial, includes an interactive mapview of each location, along with a description and an icon. Utilizes views, animations, user-input, and JSON data. Recently added "favorites only" feature. Currently working on adding hike data, graphs, and views.
